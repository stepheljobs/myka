# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Next.js that provides a native app-like installation experience on both Android and iOS devices. The app will use Firebase for data persistence and implement neobrutalism design principles for a distinctive visual style. The focus is on creating an optimal user experience that rivals native app store installations while maintaining web accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to install the PWA on my device with a seamless app store-like experience, so that I can access the app quickly from my home screen without going through a browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the PWA on Android THEN the system SHALL display a custom install prompt with app branding
2. WHEN a user visits the PWA on iOS THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for adding to home screen
3. WHEN the PWA is installed THEN the system SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI
4. WHEN the app is launched from the home screen THEN the system SHALL display a custom splash screen
5. IF the user has already installed the app THEN the system SHALL NOT show installation prompts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PWA to work offline and provide fast loading times, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loses internet connection THEN the system SHALL continue to function with cached content
2. WHEN the user visits previously loaded pages offline THEN the system SHALL display cached versions
3. WHEN new content is available online THEN the system SHALL update the cache in the background
4. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display content within 2 seconds on 3G networks
5. WHEN critical resources fail to load THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful offline fallbacks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have a distinctive neobrutalism design that feels modern and engaging, so that I enjoy using the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL display bold, high-contrast design elements
2. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the system SHALL provide tactile visual feedback with shadow effects
3. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL use chunky typography and geometric shapes
4. WHEN the user navigates THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent neobrutalism styling across all pages
5. WHEN the app is viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the neobrutalism elements responsively

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be saved and synchronized across devices, so that I can access my information from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or modifies data THEN the system SHALL save it to Firebase in real-time
2. WHEN a user accesses the app from a different device THEN the system SHALL display their synchronized data
3. WHEN the user is offline THEN the system SHALL queue data changes for synchronization when online
4. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using last-write-wins strategy
5. IF Firebase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL store data locally and sync when service is restored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PWA to meet all technical requirements for app store distribution, so that it can potentially be published to app stores if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is audited THEN the system SHALL score above 90 on Lighthouse PWA metrics
2. WHEN the manifest is validated THEN the system SHALL include all required PWA manifest properties
3. WHEN service workers are tested THEN the system SHALL properly handle caching and offline scenarios
4. WHEN the app is analyzed THEN the system SHALL meet Web App Manifest and Service Worker requirements
5. WHEN security is evaluated THEN the system SHALL serve all content over HTTPS

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to provide native-like interactions and gestures, so that it feels like a real mobile application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user swipes on touch devices THEN the system SHALL respond with appropriate navigation or actions
2. WHEN the user taps elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN the user scrolls THEN the system SHALL provide smooth, momentum-based scrolling
4. WHEN the user performs gestures THEN the system SHALL prevent default browser behaviors where appropriate
5. WHEN the app handles touch events THEN the system SHALL support multi-touch interactions where relevant

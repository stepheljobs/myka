  const options = {
    body: 'Time to start your healthy morning routine!',
    icon: '/icons/icon-192x192.png',
    badge: '/icons/icon-72x72.png',
    vibrate: [200, 100, 200],
    data: {
      type: 'morning-routine',
      date: new Date().toISOString()
    },
    actions: [
      {
        action: 'log-weight',
        title: 'Log Weight',
        icon: '/icons/weight-icon.png'
      },
      {
        action: 'drink-water',
        title: 'Drink Water',
        icon: '/icons/water-icon.png'
      },
      {
        action: 'snooze',
        title: 'Snooze 10min',
        icon: '/icons/snooze-icon.png'
      }
    ]
  };

  event.waitUntil(
    self.registration.showNotification('Good Morning! ðŸŒ…', options)
  );
});
```

### Notification Scheduling
- Use `setInterval` for daily scheduling
- Store notification schedule in IndexedDB for offline support
- Handle timezone changes and daylight saving time
- Implement snooze functionality with exponential backoff

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Required
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.0.0",
    "recharts": "^2.8.0",
    "date-fns": "^2.30.0",
    "react-hook-form": "^7.45.0",
    "zod": "^3.22.0"
  }
}
```

### External Services
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications
- Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
- Optional: Integration with health platforms (Apple Health, Google Fit)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Push notification reliability**: Implement fallback mechanisms
- **Offline data sync conflicts**: Use timestamp-based conflict resolution
- **Performance with large datasets**: Implement pagination and data archiving

### User Experience Risks
- **Notification fatigue**: Allow customization and smart scheduling
- **Data entry friction**: Provide quick input methods and defaults
- **Feature complexity**: Progressive disclosure and guided onboarding

## Conclusion

This morning routine notification feature will provide users with a structured, motivating way to start their day with healthy habits. The implementation leverages the existing PWA infrastructure while adding sophisticated notification and tracking capabilities. The phased approach ensures steady progress while maintaining code quality and user experience standards.
